0.06001 2010-06-23 06:10:00 CET

 * Simply a bug in this Changes file!
   (The method "split_with_placeholders" described below, was called
   "splitter_with_placeholders").

0.06000 2010-06-23 06:00:00 CET

 * By an unfortunate accident, the advertised "split_with_placeholders"
   (instance) method did not exist, since it had been renamed to the
   (undocumented) "_split_with_placeholders". Now
   "split_with_placeholders" has been restored (and works exaclty as
   documented), while "_split_with_placeholders" has been left just in case
   someone who did not find the public method was using it.
 
 * Minimum SQL::SplitStatement required version has been bumped to 0.05003.
 
 * Minor docs and tests additions.

 * End of deprecation cycle on "split" as a class method.

   parameter, in which case no split is performed.
 
  * Now SQL-SplitStatement-0.05000 is required, which has many enhancements.

0.03000 2010-05-30 04:00:00 CET # NEVER RELEASED TO CPAN

 * "do()" can now take /flat/ "@bind_values" exaclty as DBI's "do()".

 * SQL-SplitStatement-0.03000 is now required, which has the
   "split_with_placeholders" method.
 
 * Assorted minor code and docs enhancements.

0.01002 2010-05-28 19:15:00 CET
